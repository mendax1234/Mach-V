# AMD IP Design

As mentioned in the [previous documentation](native-design.md), if I only use the unrolling technique, it is impossible for me to reach higher frequency while keeping the cycles for multiplication and division low. Therefore, I decided to use the Xilinix IP cores (Multiplier and Divider) to implement the multiply and divide unit.
